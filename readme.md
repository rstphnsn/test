# Apperio JavaScript Test

## Introduction

## Getting started

Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/rstphnsn/test.git test && cd test`

Install the appâ€™s node dependencies

`npm install`

The default grunt task builds a deployable application into the `html` folder.

`grunt`

## Running locally and developer workflow

Run `grunt dev` on the root folder.

This provides a local connect server on:

`http://localhost:3000`

Do your work in the `dev` folder. Grunt will push changes into the HTML folder. LiveReload is supported.
